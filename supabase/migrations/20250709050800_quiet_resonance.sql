  # Fix infinite recursion in user_profiles RLS policies

  1. Problem
    - Current policies for super admin access create infinite recursion
    - Policies query user_profiles table from within user_profiles policies
    
  2. Solution
    - Drop existing recursive policies
    - Create new policies that avoid self-referencing queries
    - Use auth.jwt() claims or simpler approaches where possible
    
  3. Changes
    - Remove recursive "Super admins can read all profiles" policy
    - Remove recursive "Super admins can update user roles" policy  
    - Add new non-recursive policies for admin access

  END IF;
END $$;

-- Create new non-recursive policies for admin access
-- Note: These policies will be more restrictive initially to avoid recursion
-- Super admins will need to be managed through direct database access or service role

-- Allow users to read their own profile (this one was fine)
-- Policy already exists: "Users can read own profile"

-- Allow users to update their own profile (this one was fine) 
-- Policy already exists: "Users can update own profile"

-- For now, we'll create a simple policy that allows reading all profiles
-- but only for authenticated users (admins can be managed separately)
